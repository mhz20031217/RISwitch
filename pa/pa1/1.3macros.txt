Firstly, When a macro `IF%` is expanded, it is expanded to `MUX%`. The details
of `MUX%` is explained in the next paragraph. The function of `MUX%` is to
choose from the two options followed in the argument list according to the
property of the macro. `IF%` is defined to `__KEEP` or `__IGNORE`, which are
simple macros to keep (simply expand to the argument) or ignore (to discard
the argument).

Secondly, how does `MUX%` determine the state of the macro? In
`MUX_MACRO_PROPERTY`, the property is concatenated in the macro name through
macro `MUX_WITH_COMMA` and `CHOOSE2nd` (in concatenation, a comma is added
after the property, thus CHOOSE2nd will choose code snippet X when the
property is defined, else Y);
